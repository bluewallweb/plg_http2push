# Introduction

HTTP/2 Push is a feature of the latest HTTP revision that enables the web server
to preemptively send resources to the requesting client before the client knows
that they are needed. As a result, the number of round-trips that are required
to fully load a web page may be reduced, resulting in a potentially large
performance boost (especially on slow cellular networks).

# System Requirements

Several system requirements must be met before you can make appropriate use of
this plugin:

1. PHP `7.1`+
2. Joomla! `3.8`+
3. HTTP/2 web server with push capability:
   1. Apache `2.4.17`+ (with `mod_http2`)
   2. NGINX `1.13.9`+

# Installation

[Click here] to download the latest release of the plugin. Once the plugin is
downloaded, navigate to 'Extensions' > 'Manage' > 'Install' on your Joomla!
site, then click on the 'Upload Package File' tab. Next, drag the downloaded
ZIP archive into the upload area to install it.

**Tip**: For extra security, make sure that the "Verified" tag appears in the
left column on the release page. This means that the release was signed and
validated using GPG.

# Configuration

Configuration for this plugin can be found on your Joomla! site under
'Extensions' > 'Plugins' by searching for 'HTTP/2 Push' and clicking on the
plugin name.

Once you reach the plugin configuration page, hover over the field labels for a
detailed description of each.

# Implementation Details

This project is a system plugin for Joomla! that intercepts the
[onAfterRender] event. Once the event is triggered, the plugin parses the HTTP
response body to find any applicable resources that can be configured for
preload or preconnect.

The plugin then sets a [Link] header to inform the web server about the
resulting resources. Once the web server is made aware, all (or some) of the
resources are pushed to the client.
